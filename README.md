# React Router Version 6

#### lesson 01

---

### Description

1. install react-router-dom
2. connect to the browser's url in the main.jsx file
3. create your first route with the **Home** component as the element. The Home component needs props. Make sure to inject them through your route tag.
4. create another route, this time for the **Workshops** component
5. in the **Workshops** component, import the getWorkshops function from the api.js file.
6. loop through the data, you received from the getWorkshops function, to create a list that shows all workshop names from the dataset.
   Place the list right under the heading. Remember that each list needs a unique key!
